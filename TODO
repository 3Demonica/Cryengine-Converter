TODO File

Currently at version 0.1, which can successfully export an obj file to the console, which can be cut/paste and 
imported into Blender.

Version 0.8
- Output to a user defined file (default to <object name.obj>)
- Usage output  **COMPLETE** 7/30 
- Switch implementation:
  - -flipUV (probably default on, since I've never had to not do this)
  - -obj (export to obj) 
  - -blend (export to .blend, to be implemented in 1.0) (can be used in conjunction with -obj)
  - -output <filename> (where to write the output file; default to .cgf/.cga input directory)
- Figure out how to convert 8 byte vertex info into 3 vertices **COMPLETE** 7/25
- Bug fix so some .obj files import properly to Blender (exploded geometry issue)
- Refactor to use Where(a=>a.blahblah==blahblahblah) and clean up classes. **COMPLETE** 7/30
- add build version into the output
- .mtl files:  Find the associated mtl file for the .cgf file from the MtlName chunk.
- Add support for Cryengine 3.6 and newer files **COMPLETE** 8/1

Version 0.9
- .mtl files - convert Cryengine .mtl files to .obj .mtl files.  Better mtl file handling (search given obj dirs)
- Break classes into separate files.
- Input validation, error checking, etc.

Version 1.0
- Export directly to .blend files
