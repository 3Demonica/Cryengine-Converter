TODO File

Currently at version 0.1, which can successfully export an obj file to the console, which can be cut/paste and 
imported into Blender.

Version 0.8
- Output to a user defined file (default to <object name.obj>
- Usage output
- Switch implementation:
  - -flipUV (probably default on, since I've never had to not do this)
  - -obj (export to obj) | -blend (export to .blend, to be implemented in 1.0)
  - -output <filename> (where to write the output file; default to .cgf/.cga input directory)
- Figure out how to convert 8 byte vertex info into 3 vertices
- Bug fix so some .obj files import properly to Blender.

Version 0.9
- Add support for Cryengine 3.6 and newer files
- Better support for .mtl files

Version 1.0
- Export directly to .blend files
